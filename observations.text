Tn this lab , I learnt many things.
* Graphics through fltk was totally new.
*Firstly, How to open a new window.
*How to creat buttons.
*how to label buttons.
*the handle function.
*a bit about puzzle (15 puzzle)





I observed that all these, we learnt in lab 4 about , is of great importance in real life, specially for user of a device,
we can use this fltk ( or other graffic) stuff to make the interface of a device more understandable to its user.
